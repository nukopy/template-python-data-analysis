# Template for Data Analysis with Python

## Setup

1. Build the Docker image with the command `make b` (takes few minutes)
2. Start the Docker container on background with the command `make u`
3. Open the development environment:
   - If you wanna develop on Jupyter Lab, open [http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab](http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab) on your browser
   - If you wanna develop on Visual Studio Code, press `cmd + shift + P` on Visual Studio Code and select **"Remote - Containers: Reopen in Container"**
4. Stop & Remove the Docker container with the command `make d`

```sh
# 1. Build the Docker image
make b

# 2. Start the Docker container on background
make u

# 4. Stop & Remove the Docker container
make d
```
